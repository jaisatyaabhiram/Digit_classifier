# 🧠 MNIST Digit Recognizer – Deep Learning with ANN

This project is part of **Day 4 of the 7 Days of AI Challenge**: Learn Deep Learning fundamentals by building an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

## 🔍 Project Overview

We build and train a simple ANN from scratch using **TensorFlow and Keras** to classify handwritten digits (0–9). The model is trained on the **MNIST dataset**, which contains 70,000 labeled images of handwritten digits.
